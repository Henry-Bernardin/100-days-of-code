# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: April 26, 2018- Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself via FreeCodeCamp, on Compound assignments w/ augumented addition, multiplication, subtraction and division. These operators do both a mathematical operation, and assignment in 1 step. Also refreshed on escaping literal quotes in strings by using a backslash. 

**Thoughts:** I have to ensure that I constantly code. As soon as I begin practicing it all comes back, but I have to stop with the long breaks in between studying, and coding.

Day 2: April 28, 2018- Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself via FreeCodeCamp lessons on Concatenating strings w/ plus(+) operators, w/ the plus equals(+=) operator, w/ variables. Appending variables to strings w/ (+=). Finding the length of a string (.length). & using bracket notation[] to find a character in a string.

**Thoughts:** Refreshing on the past material is coming along better. I realize it helps for me to not only type the code on a web browser/computer, but to also write it down on pen and paper.

Day 3: April 30, 2018- Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on String Immutability. Using Bracket Notation to find the Nth character in a string. Using Bracket Notation to find the last character in a string. Using Arrays to store multiple values in one var. How to access Array Data w/ Indexes(Zero Based).

**Thoughts:** This material which I have refreshed on today I remember a majority of it.

Day 4: May 1, 2018- Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on nesting one Array within another Array. How Arrays are mutable and can be changed freely. Accessing multidimensional arrays with indexes. Manipulating Arrays with “.push()”, appending data to the end, .pop() , removing data at the end ( "popped" off data can be stored in another assigned variable). ".shift()" removes data at the front, and ".unshift()" adds data to the front. 

Refreshed on Functions() and their use. How "Parameters" are placeholders for values, called "Arguments". 
 
Refreshed on the term "scope", and how it is the visibility level of a variable within, and outside a function. Variables    that can be accessed outside of a function have "Global Scope", "Local Scope" are variables that can only be accessed     within a function. If two variables have the same exact name, 1 is global, and another is local. the Local variable will take precedence. And finally, the "return" statement can be used to send a value back out of a function.  

**Thoughts:** Refreshed on alot of material, today via FreeCodeCamp. But was stuck on a problem caleld "Stand In Line", which I am still trying to figure out (although I have already seen the solution for it in the past, but I believe that is what I need to work on, which is to solve these problems completely on my own before looking at their solutions)

Day 5: May 4, 2018- Friday  

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on BooLean values (True, False), Conditional logic with "If" statements, Equality operator (==), Strict Equaility (===), Inequaility Operator (!=), which means "Not Equal", example  1 != 2 // true. Strict InEquality Operator (!==), which means "Strictly not equal", example: 3 !== '3'//true.Strict inequality will not convert data types. Greater than, and Greater than or equal to Operator (>)(>=). Less Than, and Less Than or equal to Operator (<)(<=). The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true.And finally "if", "else if", and "else" statements. 

**Thoughts:** solved the "Stand In Line" problem, but had some help within the FreeCodeCamp forums. The second go round reshing all the material I mentioned, was very productive. i actully understood it a bit more than when I was first was exposed to it.

Day 6: May 18, 2018- Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on switch statements. And adding a Default option in switch statements. 

**Thoughts:** Wasnt able to zone in since I've been back at work, but I will refocus on this challenge. I forgot how to do switch statements, but after tinkering for a bit, I remebered alot of it.

Day 7: June 6, 2018- Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on Javascript objects, accessing object properties with Dot Notation, Bracket Notation, and variables. Updating Object Properties (adding & deleting Object Properties).

**Thoughts:** I have finally bought a monitor for my Macbook Pro and it really helps with coding. I remember a good amount when it comes to Javascript objects. I'm having a issue with GitHub capturing when I update this Log. I will try to figure it out over the weekend.

Day 8: June 11, 2018- Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on using Objects for Lookups. Worked on solving the Basic Javascript: using Objects for lookups challenge on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I had to use a YouTube tutorial explanation in order to solve this challenge. But with its explanation I finally understand how to utilize the Objects lookups, especially with the use of the variables, when it came time to switch it around to express a result.

Day 9: July 23, 2018- Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on testing objects for properties, using the ".hasOwnProperty(PropertyName)" method of objects. ".hasOwnProperty()" returns True or False if the property is found or not.

**Thoughts** Understood this pretty well.
